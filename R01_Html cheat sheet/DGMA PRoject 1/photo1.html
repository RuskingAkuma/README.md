      <figcaption>This is my favourite battle rpyale fps game of all time right now. I was never really a fan of the new COD games and cod got boring to me bc im a big fan of fantasy, magical abilities and magic. This game has cool character design, amazing lore tied with one of my favorite games Titanfall and it is genuinly fun to play and ive been obsessed with it ever since it came out the summer of 2019. Bloodhound is my Favorite character design and lore wise. they are so cool and their past is very mysterious and also interesting at the same time. They are a part of a tribe that worship their form of god names the allfather. This bloodhound has a hatchet and a raven that is linked with them.</figcaption>
